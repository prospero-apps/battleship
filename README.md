Instructions:
1. Enter your name.
2. Place your ships one by one as asked. Use the horizontal and vertical buttons before placement.
3. Shoot by clicking on the squares. If you hit, a red cross sign appears on that square. Otherwise, there's a black blurry star. In the map below you can watch your fleet all the time.
